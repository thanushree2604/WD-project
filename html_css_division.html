            Data science is a deep study of the massive amount of data, which involves extracting meaningful insights from raw, structured, and unstructured data that is processed using the scientific method, different technologies, and algorithms.It is a multidisciplinary field that uses tools and techniques to manipulate the data so that you can find something new and meaningful.Data science uses the most powerful hardware, programming systems, and most efficient algorithms to solve the data related problems. It is the future of artificial intelligence.

            In short, we can say that data science is all about:
            
            Asking the correct questions and analyzing the raw data.
            Modeling the data using various complex and efficient algorithms.
            Visualizing the data to get a better perspective.
            Understanding the data to make better decisions and finding the final result.
